        <p class="hidden">Person-specific data for affect recognition models is scarce, and generalized models often struggle 
            with accuracy due to individual differences. Cluster-based personalization has been proposed as a 
            compromise between generalized and fully personalized affect recognition from biosignals. This study 
            investigated whether grouping participants by Big-Five personality profiles can improve 
            user-independent prediction of continuous valence and arousal ratings. Cardiac and electrodermal 
            features were extracted from two public datasets, AMIGOS and PhyMER. The datasets consisted of both 
            short recordings (50-250 seconds) and long recordings (14-24 minutes). Three variants were evaluated: 
            Baseline, which used only biosignals; Clusters, which added personality-based cluster assignments; and
             Traits, which added personality scores directly. Each variant was implemented with the Random Forests 
             (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms. As anticipated, the Baseline models across 
             datasets struggled with large individual differences, resulting in limited explained variance of 
             valence and arousal levels. However, informing models of personality-based subgroups did not improve 
             the generalization of the models. Neither personality representation produced notable or systematic 
             improvements over the Baseline. Generally, models trained on short segments exhibited improved 
             performance compared to those trained on long segments. RF performed better for arousal, while SVR 
             performed better for valence. Furthermore, our results confirm that recognizing continuous valence 
             and arousal levels of unseen users is a nontrivial task, and individual variability likely diffuses 
             the relationships between biosignals and affective labels. Future work should focus on improving the
              understanding of the physiological and psychological processes underlying self-reported affective 
              states, using larger datasets and more advanced modeling techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory 
              (LSTM).</p>
