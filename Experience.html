        <h2>Teodora Spiridinova</h2>
            <p class="reftext"> Bachelors' thesis supervisor</p>
            <p class="reftext">"What stood out to me about Anna was her persistence, her organizational capabilities,
                and her initiative. She was always on top of things, always on time with deadlines, and
                very proactive in asking questions and clearing up issues. Her commitment to the
                project resulted in a well-written thesis that demonstrated a
                clear understanding of the theoretical and practical implications of the research. She
                also showed good communication skills throughout the project, responding to emails
                fast, and always coming to meetings prepared. In short, I found Anna to be both very
                intellectually capable and very pleasant to work with."</p>

        <p class="reftext">"Anna has shown a high level of independence during her internship. She is very proactive, positively critical, and collegial. In social interactions, she has demonstrated significant growth. Initially, she expressed some uncertainty about her place and role among colleagues and stakeholders. However, within a few weeks, she found her footing in this regard. I consider this a great example of her willingness to learn, tackle tasks outside her comfort zone, and thus, develop herself."</p>
