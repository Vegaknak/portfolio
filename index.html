        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Anna, I am a HCI Master student (Human-Computer Interaction). With a background in psychology and a great enthusiasm towards technology, I hope to connect the two through human-centered design. 
            As an advocate and enthusiast of science, I firmly believe that most decision-making processes can be significantly improved when grounded in data.
        </p>
        <p>My friends describe me as artistic, structured, hands-on, determined and ambitious. I have more interests and hobbies than the twenty four hours in the day permit me to have;
             I play bass guitar in a band and occasionally spin records at house parties. I love to dance, to read, to cook and to be out in nature. Though I am ambitious and hard-working, a healthy work-life balance is important to me and I value my relationships and personal development highly.
        </p>
        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>I'm proud to share that I built this website from scratch, without relying on generative AI or website-building tools. This site is hosted using GitHub pages. Visit my github <a href="https://github.com/Vegaknak">here</a>. As this was my first personal project using HTML, CSS and simple scripting using JavaScript,
            this project has introduced me to the world of web developemnt and UI design. I hope this is the first of many more to come!
