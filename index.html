            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> Currently I am working as a junior data analyst at Preply, which is a language learning platform that leads the market in technology-driven learning. My work focuses on supporting business decisions
                with data. My day-to-day consists of writing SQL scripts to retrieve data, develop metrics and establish pipelines, which I use to perform analyses and build dashboards with insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated my Master's degree in Information Science (track Human-Computer Interaction) in 2025 from Utrecht University. Prior to that, I studied Psychology in Tilburg University, which triggered my interest in 
                research and statistics. This curiosity towards data science was fueled by an obsession with uncertainty when explaining the world around us. Needless to say I'm a big advocate of science, 
                and I believe that any decision-making process should be grounded in data. 
                Discover how I apply this in <a href="Portfolio_redesign.html">my projects</a>!
            </p>
            <p> I'm more than my work: I have more interests and hobbies than the twenty four hours in the day permit me to have. I love to dance, to read, to cook, to roller-skate and to be out in nature. 
                I play bass guitar in a band and occasionally spin records at house parties. Intrinsic curiosity is my mantra, and I've learned that treating anything purely transactionally kills passion. 
                That's why I prioritize work-life balance and personal development.
