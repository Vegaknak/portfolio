        <p class="hidden subtext">Core skills: Designing, engineering and evaluating an interactive technology</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2 class="hidden">Project Overview</h2>
        <p class="hidden">For this project, I designed, built and evaluated a communicative technology called ‘Lobit’ with 4 other students. Lobit is a remotely connected hoodie that allows its wearers to send digital ‘hugs’ to each other. With additional features that allow for sending and receiving voice messages, Lobit digitally connects people in a more meaningful way. My main roles during the project were first prototyper and second programmer.</p>
 <br/>
 <br/>
        <h2 class="hidden">Design Phase</h2>
        <p class="hidden">Spending time on conceptualising the idea was an important step of the process. Like Lincoln said: “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.”</p>
 <br/>
        <p class="hidden"> Our creative idea generation phase lasted about 2 weeks, and with the help of concept maps and free association we landed on several options</p>
 <br/>
 
 
        <!-- <div class="hidden image">
            <img src="resources/images/Untitled.png">
        </div> -->
       
        <p class="hidden">We settled on the design based on novelty and feasibility. Additionally, we conducted a brief user study (n=3) to test the idea and its functionalities, leading us to the idea of two remotely connected hoodies, when the act of hugging oneself would send localised heating to the other user. Additionally, users can send and receive direct voice messages to one another. We created sketches and wireframes for the app.</p>
 <br/>
        <p class="hidden">The design leverages the idea of tele-presence, where it's most central to feel like you are in the presence of somebody else, when in reality you're not <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-11928-001">[1]</a>. Alongside, we observe a trend where people try to reduce their screen time, as excessive screen time is associated with increased loneliness <a href = 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02654075231158300'>[2]</a>. An important note is that our design is not meant to replace social presence, but rather a more meaningful supplement to digital communication for two long-distance individuals.</p>

        <p class="hidden">Now that the conceptualization phase was done, we moved on to creating the Lo-Fi prototype.</p>
 <br/>
 <br/>
        <h2 class="hidden">Low Fidelity Prototype and User Testing</h2>
        <p class="hidden">Leveraging an old garment for the Lo-Fi prototype, we used pieces of foam to indicate the placement of the speakers, heating & sensor pads, securing them with double sided tape, and we used clay to for the control buttons. This prototype allowed us to test the design and refine it. First, we asked people to hug themselves for optimal sensor placement. Second, we tested the wireframes and evaluated usability and understanding (n=4). Additionally, we tested feelings of enchantment <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/14673584211035774">[3]</a>. The most important points we learnt were:</p>
 <br/>
        <ul class="list hidden">
            <li>- Placement of the sensors should be in places you cannot accidentally hit</li>
            <li>- The focus of the heating should mimic a hug without being overwhelming, therefore they should be placed on chest and back</li>
            <li>- Ensure the encasing of the voice message buttons are obvious</li>
            <li>- Ensure the heating is adjustable</li>
        </ul>
 
 
        <p class="hidden">Regarding the app wireframes, it lead to the changes:</p>
            <ul class="list hidden">
                <li>- Add notifications for voice messages received and when other is wearing the hoodie</li>
                <li>- Improve guidance for setting the device up in the app (Device configuration)</li>
                <li>- Create separate page for partner and own hoodie</li>
                <li>- Clarify that the product is for pairing only (no multiple connections)</li>
            </ul>
 
 
 <br/>
        <p class="hidden">Participants responded enthusiastically to our idea which led us to feel confident we were headed in the right direction</p>
 <br/>
        <p class="hidden">We concluded the Low-Fi phase by naming our idea ‘Lobit’, referring to the Surinamese word for Lobi, meaning 'love' (two of our group members are of Surinamese descent). The 't' at the end creates the word 'bit', a term referring to the technical nature of this project.</p>
 
 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 
 
        <h2 class="hidden">High Fidelity Prototype </h2>
            <p class="hidden">We started testing our electronics and soldering the pins to the Arduino ESP-32. <p>
 <br/>
            <p class="hidden">Unfortunately, the heating pads did not heat up fast enough nor hot enough to notice any significant difference; while for our design this needed to be instant. An alternative to heating pads was using resistance wire directly.</p>
 <br/>       
            <p class="hidden">Resistance wiring works as electrical current runs through the length of the wire, resisting the flow of electricity and generates heat as a result of the resistance \cite{scherz2006practical}. We experimented with wiring for floor heating, which were quick to heat up, but when the wiring was moving out of place, the distribution of heat was shifting, resulting in really hot spots, very unsuitable for embedding in wearables. Alternatively, we ordered resistive, polyamide foil that mitigated this problem. </p>
 <br/>
            <p class="hidden"> We configured the communication between the two ESP-32’s. We found Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to be a suitable method for this, as MQTT allows for efficient communication between devices (especially over constrained networks like WiFi \cite{ibm-mqtt-doc}) and supports fully symmetrical connection. The microcontrollers connect to a smartphone hotspot, accessing the MQTT broker hosted on an existing server provided by our University. This way, the ESP-32’S can publish (send) and subscribe (receive) to specific topics on the broker.</p>
 <br/>
            <p class="hidden">Unfortunately, the polyamide foil never arrived, which led us to find an alternative to haptic feedback. Instead, we used a small vibration motor. We connected this to a relay module to control its power supply easily.</p>
 <br/>

 <br/>
            <p class="hidden">When all circuits were finalized, I transferred them onto perfboard, acting as a permanent replacement of a breadboard, which was necessary because we wanted to implement it in a garment and therefore needed to be smaller and more sturdy.</p>

 <br/>
 <br/>
        <h2 class="hidden">Evaluation</h2>
        <p>The last step was to examine the overall user experience and impact of the Lobit as alternative communication technology compared to smartphone communication. Using a mixed-methods approach in a within-subjects design, we evaluated Lobit's impact on feelings of connectedness and enchantment compared to regular communication with a loved one. This lead to the following research question(s):</p>
        <div class="hidden image">
            <img src="resources/images/Untitled 3.png">
        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>We recruited six individuals forming three pairs (one romantic and two platonic) who regularly communicate long-distance. The participants, with an average age of 22 and a relationship duration of approximately 2.3 years, were exposed to two conditions: using Lobit and using smartphones for communcation. Each session lasted about an hour, with the order of conditions randomized to control for any order effects.</p>
        <br/>
 
 
        <p>Data Collection and Tools</p>
        <p>Data was collected through checklists and semi-structured interviews. The Networked Minds Social Presence Questionnaire and an enchantment adjective checklist were used to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the participants' feelings of social presence and enchantment. Voice memos recorded the sessions, and transcription software helped in analyzing the qualitative data.</p>
       
        <br/>
        <p>Results</p>
        <p>Our study showed that Lobit significantly enhanced feelings of social presence and enchantment compared to smartphone communication. The average social presence score was higher in the Lobit condition (15.3) than in the smartphone condition (12.0). Participants felt more connected and attentive to their partners while using Lobit. Enchantment scores were also higher with Lobit, with participants experiencing more positive emotions such as joy and excitement. Interestingly, while Lobit improved perceived social presence and enchantment, inter-subjective symmetry was higher in the smartphone condition, suggesting that actual mutual understanding might be better in conventional communication modes.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The qualitative data supported the quantitative findings, with participants expressing a greater sense of connection and enchantment when using Lobit. The functionalities of sending hugs and voice messages were particularly appreciated, enhancing the emotional quality of the communication. However, some participants noted that the vibration could become annoying over time, and there were concerns about the practicality of heat as a substitute for physical warmth in a hug.</p>
 <br/>
  <br/>
 
 
        <p>Overall, Lobit may offer a promising enhancement to long-distance communication, possibly fostering a stronger sense of social presence and enchantment than traditional text-based methods. However, the current study did not capture the significance nor effect size of the findings. Further research on incorporating tangible interactions into communication technologies are needed to discover the potential to deepen emotional connections between users. In general, this prototype is an expample of how we can incorporate the need for more nuanced and emotionally aware technological solutions.</p>

        <h2 class="hidden">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>Prototyping is generally defined as an experimental process <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EUM0000000003546/full/html">[6]</a>, and I have seen why; it was a process of adaptation, testing out various approaches and designs to adapt to unforeseen issues, and that meant letting go of ideas that weren't always feasible. Now having been through the whole process, I think if I were to do a similar project for a second time we could progress much faster, underlining the importance of having been through this process in the first place. </p>
        <br/>
       <p>Overall, it was awesome we got to bring our ideas into reality. I am proud of what we managed to achieve in such a short time frame, especially considering how little familiarity we had with such a project. I have learned a great deal and this project was such an exciting journey. </p>
